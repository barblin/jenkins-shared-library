# jenkins-shared-library

Serves as a collection of routines and build pipelines to simplify the creation of a global shared build pipeline repository. 
This project contains examples of general purpose build pipelines, general configuration, teams notifications and supports the use of jdk-8 and jdk-11 to build artefacts either used in a Wildfly Container, standalone SpringBoot applications or Docker Images.
